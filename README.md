# Brand Preference - Predicting the brand preference based on Uncomplete Survey

### Project Goal: The sales team engaged a market research firm to conduct a survey of our existing customers. One of the objectives of the survey was to find out which of two brands of computers our customers prefer. This information will help us decide with which manufacturer we should pursue a deeper strategic relationship. Unfortunately, the answer to the brand preference question was not properly captured for all of the respondents, for this we need to predict the brand preference based on this uncomplete survey.

### Data characteristics: we have been provided with two surveys, one, the complete account with 10,000 observations with variables such as salary, age, educational level, car, zipcode, credit and brand and another with 5,000 observations but with the incomplete brand variable.
